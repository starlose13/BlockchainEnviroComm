msgid "**UUPSUpgradeable**"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/docs_upgradable_contract.rst:20
msgid "*Purpose*: The `UUPSUpgradeable` contract from OpenZeppelin supports upgradability by adhering to the Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS). This allows updating the contract's logic while preserving its state."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/docs_upgradable_contract.rst:23
msgid "*Functionality*: - **Upgradability**: Enables updating contract logic through a delegated upgrade mechanism, maintaining the contract's state during upgrades."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/docs_upgradable_contract.rst:26
msgid "*Integration*: Implemented in both the Node Manager and Consensus Mechanism contracts to manage contract upgrades effectively."
