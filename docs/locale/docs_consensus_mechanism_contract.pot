msgid "The `ConsensusMechanism` contract orchestrates decision-making processes among network agents. It manages critical functions such as target location reporting, simulation execution, consensus automation, and epoch management. It collaborates with the `NodeManager` contract to verify node registration and validate participation, ensuring the integrity of consensus operations."
