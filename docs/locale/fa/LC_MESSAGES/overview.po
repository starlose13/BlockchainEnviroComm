"The Command and Control (C2) system consists of a set of communication "
"and computer equipment designed to facilitate decision-making and "
"battlefield management. In this system, the continuous collection, "
"processing, and dissemination of environmental information, and "
"maintaining communication between members, are crucial. Processed "
"information provides commanders with a comprehensive picture of the "
"environment, enabling organization, guidance, coordination, and control "
"of forces.[1]"

"Due to the specialized and mission-oriented nature of drones and military"
" equipment, issues such as information access, integrity, and "
"confidentiality are of paramount importance in cybersecurity and military"
" contexts. The speed of information transfer, data storage capacity, and "
"accurate and transparent command exchange necessitate a secure and "
"reliable infrastructure. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as "
"blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) can address many of these "
"security risks and challenges. Since its emergence in 2009, blockchain "
"technology has proven to be an effective tool in countering intrusions, "
"facilitating secure data sharing and storage, and tracking processes. "
"This project presents a simulation of a Command and Control system using "
"blockchain-based intelligent agents, which represents a significant "
"advancement in command and control management."

msgid "Problem Definition"
msgstr ""

#: ../overview.rst:19
msgid ""
"In military command and control, especially when local agents exist in "
"the battlefield, several challenges arise. These challenges include "
"information security, distributed decision-making, situational awareness,"
" data accuracy, and security issues related to reliance on a central "
"management system."
msgstr ""

#: ../overview.rst:21
msgid ""
"To address these challenges, blockchain technology can be utilized as a "
"decentralized and secure data structure for recording and protecting "
"information. In this scenario, the system must implement a mechanism for "
"decision-making and consensus for independent and autonomous agents based"
" on Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) algorithms. This mechanism allows "
"agents to reach a final decision through decentralized voting, "
"facilitating real-time collaborative operations. The use of blockchain-"
"based command and control systems offers benefits such as high-speed "
"target identification, distributed decision-making, situational "
"awareness, transparent information exchange among authorized agents, "
"secure and rapid information transfer, which can lead to reduced "
"operational errors, increased reliability, and decreased delays and "
"interruptions in command and control systems."
