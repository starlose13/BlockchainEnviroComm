"The `MinimalAccountAbstraction` contract provides a foundational "
"implementation of account abstraction, facilitating the abstraction of "
"user operations and transaction execution. It interfaces with an entry "
"point to validate user operations and manage transactions, thereby "
"streamlining account management in a decentralized environment."

#: ../docs_minimal_account_abstraction.rst:15
msgid ""
"**`i_entryPoint`** (`address`): The address of the entry point contract "
"responsible for initiating and validating user operations. This address "
"ensures that operations are processed through the designated entry point,"
" maintaining operational integrity."

"the authorized entry point can invoke the function, thereby preserving "
"the integrity of operations."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs_minimal_account_abstraction.rst:23
msgid ""
"**`requireFromEntryPointOrOwner()`**: Allows the function to be executed "
