Project Title
=============

Overview
--------

The Command and Control (C2) system consists of a set of communication and computer equipment designed to facilitate decision-making and battlefield management. In this system, the continuous collection, processing, and dissemination of environmental information, and maintaining communication between members, are crucial. Processed information provides commanders with a comprehensive picture of the environment, enabling organization, guidance, coordination, and control of forces.[1]

Due to the specialized and mission-oriented nature of drones and military equipment, issues such as information access, integrity, and confidentiality are of paramount importance in cybersecurity and military contexts. The speed of information transfer, data storage capacity, and accurate and transparent command exchange necessitate a secure and reliable infrastructure. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) can address many of these security risks and challenges. Since its emergence in 2009, blockchain technology has proven to be an effective tool in countering intrusions, facilitating secure data sharing and storage, and tracking processes. This project presents a simulation of a Command and Control system using blockchain-based intelligent agents, which represents a significant advancement in command and control management.

Problem Definition
-------------------

In military command and control, especially when drones act as intelligent agents in the battlefield, several challenges arise. These challenges include information security, distributed decision-making, situational awareness, data accuracy, and security issues related to reliance on a central management system.

To address these challenges, blockchain technology can be utilized as a decentralized and secure data structure for recording and protecting information. In this scenario, drones will process environmental data using distributed AI algorithms and then store the processed data in blockchain blocks. Advanced encryption algorithms will be employed to ensure data security during exchange. Through AI, drones will perform advanced processing and target identification.

Next, the system must implement a mechanism for decision-making and consensus for independent and autonomous drones based on Byzantine fault tolerance algorithms. This mechanism allows drones to reach a final decision through decentralized voting, facilitating real-time collaborative operations. The use of blockchain-based intelligent command and control systems offers benefits such as high-speed target identification, distributed decision-making, situational awareness, transparent information exchange among authorized drones, secure and rapid information transfer, which can lead to reduced operational errors, increased reliability, and decreased delays and interruptions in command and control systems.
