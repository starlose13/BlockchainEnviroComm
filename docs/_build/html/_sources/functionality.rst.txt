Specification
=============

``rtd-build`` is a tool that can build Sphinx documentation. It is used
internally by readthedocs.org to build all Sphinx based documentation.

Creating a build works like this:

- Change into the root directory of the project where you want to build the documentation.
- Run ``rtd-build``.

``rtd-build`` will then perform the following actions:

- It searches for all ``readthedocs.yml`` files below the current directory and merges all found files into a list of configurations.
- It iterates over all configurations (order is not guaranteed) and performs the following actions for each:

  - Create a fresh virtualenv.
  - ``cd`` into the base directory of the documentation.
  - ``pip install ...`` whatever is configured in the config.
  - ``python setup.py install`` if configured (from the path specified in ``python.setup_path``).
  - Run ``sphinx-build``.

``readthedocs.yml`` spec
------------------------

A ``readthedocs.yml`` file must be in YAML format. If the top level is a block
sequence (i.e. a list), then the file describes multiple configurations. If
the top level is mapping, then the file describes a single configuration.

A few complete examples:

- Config file living at the root of the repository, configuring only one
  documentation:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    # in /readthedocs.yml
    base: docs/
    type: sphinx
    formats:
        html: true
        pdf: true
    python:
        setup_install: true

- A project with multiple documentations. The one in ``docs/`` is the English
  one and considered the main documentation. ``docs-de/`` contains a second
  documentation which is the German translation of ``docs/``.

  .. code-block:: yaml

    - name: en
      type: sphinx
      language: en
      base: docs/
      python:
        requirements:
            - "-rrequirements.txt"
        setup_install: true

    - name: de
      extend: en
      language: de
      base: docs-de/

Project Specification
=====================

``blockchain-c2-simulation`` is a project that simulates a Command and Control (C2) system using blockchain-based intelligent agents. It is designed to address security and efficiency challenges in military operations.

Creating a build works like this:

- Change into the root directory of the project where you want to build the documentation.
- Run ``rtd-build``.

``rtd-build`` will then perform the following actions:

- It searches for all ``readthedocs.yml`` files below the current directory and merges all found files into a list of configurations.
- It iterates over all configurations (order is not guaranteed) and performs the following actions for each:

  - Create a fresh virtualenv.
  - ``cd`` into the base directory of the documentation.
  - ``pip install ...`` whatever is configured in the config.
  - ``python setup.py install`` if configured (from the path specified in ``python.setup_path``).
  - Run ``sphinx-build``.
