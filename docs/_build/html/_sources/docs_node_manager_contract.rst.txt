NodeManager Contract Documentation
====================================

Overview
--------

The `NodeManager` contract plays a critical role in the administration and regulation of nodes within a decentralized network. It is responsible for node registration, status management, and querying node information. By maintaining a well-organized registry, it ensures network integrity and effective node management.

Key Components
--------------

**State Variables:**

- **`s_registeredNodes`** (`mapping(address => bool)`):
  A mapping that tracks whether nodes are registered. Each address represents a node, with a boolean value indicating its registration status (active or inactive).

- **`s_nodeCount`** (`uint256`):
  This variable tracks the total number of nodes currently registered within the network, aiding in node management and providing insights into the network's scale.

- **`s_admin`** (`address`):
  The address of the contract administrator who holds exclusive rights to perform administrative tasks such as node registration and status updates.

**Functions:**

Register Node
----------------

The `registerNode` function facilitates the registration of new nodes in the network. This operation is essential for onboarding and expanding the network.

```solidity
function registerNode(address nodeAddress) external
```

*Parameters:*

- **`nodeAddress`** (`address`):
  The address of the node to be registered. It must be unique and comply with network standards.

*Usage:*

Invoke this function to register a new node. It updates the `s_registeredNodes` mapping to reflect the node’s registration status.

*Security Considerations:*

- **Access Control:** Ensure only authorized entities can call this function to prevent unauthorized registrations.
- **Validation:** Validate the `nodeAddress` to avoid duplicates or invalid registrations.

Update Node Status
-------------------

The `updateNodeStatus` function modifies a node’s registration status, allowing it to be set as active or inactive, thereby reflecting its current state.

```solidity
function updateNodeStatus(address nodeAddress, bool status) external
```

*Parameters:*

- **`nodeAddress`** (`address`):
  The address of the node whose status is being updated.

- **`status`** (`bool`):
  The new status of the node. `true` indicates active, while `false` indicates inactive.

*Usage:*

Call this function to change the status of a registered node. This is crucial for dynamically managing node participation in the network.

*Security Considerations:*

- **Access Control:** Limit this function’s access to the contract administrator or other authorized roles to prevent unauthorized updates.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure the `nodeAddress` exists in the network before updating its status.

Get Node Status
----------------

The `getNodeStatus` function queries the current registration status of a node, providing essential information about the network's state.

```solidity
function getNodeStatus(address nodeAddress) external view returns (bool)
```

*Parameters:*

- **`nodeAddress`** (`address`):
  The address of the node whose status is queried.

*Returns:*

- **`bool`**:
  The current registration status of the node. Returns `true` if active, `false` if inactive.

*Usage:*

Use this function to retrieve a node’s status, useful for monitoring and validating node states within the network.

*Security Considerations:*

- **Access Control:** Though this function is external and view-only, ensure it does not inadvertently expose sensitive network details.

Application
-----------

The `NodeManager` contract is vital for effective node management in a decentralized network. It ensures proper registration, status updates, and information retrieval, supporting network scalability and reliability through essential administrative functions.

Security Considerations
------------------------

- **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls for critical functions like node registration and status updates to prevent unauthorized access and maintain network security.

- **Data Integrity:** Validate all node-related data to prevent incorrect or malicious registrations. Implement input validation and consistency checks to ensure legitimate nodes are registered.

- **Administrative Privileges:** Restrict administrative functions to trusted, audited entities. Regularly review and audit these privileges to prevent misuse and ensure secure network management.

- **Scalability and Performance:** Assess the impact of node management functions on contract performance and gas costs, especially in large networks. Optimize state variable usage and function logic for efficient operations.

- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling to manage unexpected conditions gracefully, providing clear error messages for debugging and maintenance.
