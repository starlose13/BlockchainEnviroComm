NodeManager Contract Documentation
====================================

Overview
--------

The `NodeManager` contract is pivotal in the administration and regulation of nodes within a decentralized network. It handles critical functionalities related to node registration, status management, and provides mechanisms for querying node information. By maintaining an organized registry of nodes, it ensures network integrity and efficient node management.

Key Components
--------------

**State Variables:**

- **`s_registeredNodes`** (`mapping(address => bool)`):
  - A mapping that tracks the registration status of nodes. Each address represents a node, and the corresponding boolean value indicates whether the node is registered and active.

- **`s_nodeCount`** (`uint256`):
  - Tracks the total number of nodes currently registered within the network. This counter helps in managing node-related operations and provides insights into network scale.

- **`s_admin`** (`address`):
  - The address of the contract administrator. This address has exclusive privileges for performing administrative tasks, such as node registration and status updates.

**Functions:**

---

## **Register Node**

The `registerNode` function allows for the registration of new nodes within the network. It is a fundamental operation for onboarding new nodes and expanding the network.

```solidity
function registerNode(address nodeAddress) external
```

### **Parameters**

- **`nodeAddress`** (`address`):
  - The address of the node to be registered. This address must be unique and comply with network standards.

### **Usage**

Invoke this function to add a new node to the network. The function will update the `s_registeredNodes` mapping to reflect the node's registration status.

### **Security Considerations**

- **Access Control:** Ensure that only authorized entities can call this function. Unauthorized registration could lead to network integrity issues.
- **Validation:** Validate the `nodeAddress` to prevent duplicate or invalid node registrations.

---

## **Update Node Status**

The `updateNodeStatus` function is used to modify the registration status of a node. It allows for updating a node’s status to active or inactive, reflecting its current state in the network.

```solidity
function updateNodeStatus(address nodeAddress, bool status) external
```

### **Parameters**

- **`nodeAddress`** (`address`):
  - The address of the node whose status is being updated.

- **`status`** (`bool`):
  - The new status of the node. `true` indicates the node is active, while `false` indicates it is inactive.

### **Usage**

Call this function to change the status of a registered node. This functionality is crucial for dynamically managing node participation in the network.

### **Security Considerations**

- **Access Control:** Limit this function’s access to the contract administrator or other authorized roles to prevent unauthorized status updates.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure the `nodeAddress` exists in the network before attempting to update its status.

---

## **Get Node Status**

The `getNodeStatus` function allows for querying the current registration status of a node. This function is essential for retrieving node information and assessing the network's status.

```solidity
function getNodeStatus(address nodeAddress) external view returns (bool)
```

### **Parameters**

- **`nodeAddress`** (`address`):
  - The address of the node whose status is being queried.

### **Returns**

- **`bool`**:
  - The current registration status of the node. Returns `true` if the node is active and `false` if it is inactive.

### **Usage**

Invoke this function to retrieve the status of a node. This is useful for monitoring and validating the current state of nodes within the network.

### **Security Considerations**

- **Access Control:** Although this function is external and view-only, ensure it does not inadvertently expose sensitive network details.

Application
-----------

The `NodeManager` contract is crucial for managing nodes in a decentralized network, ensuring proper registration, status management, and information retrieval. It supports network scalability and reliability by handling essential administrative tasks and providing transparency regarding node participation.

Security Considerations
------------------------

- **Access Control:** 
  Implement rigorous access control mechanisms to restrict critical functions, such as node registration and status updates, to authorized administrators. Unauthorized access can compromise network security and integrity.

- **Data Integrity:** 
  Validate all node-related data to prevent incorrect or malicious registrations. Implement input validation and consistency checks to ensure only legitimate nodes are registered.

- **Administrative Privileges:** 
  Restrict administrative functions to trusted and audited entities. Regularly review and audit administrative privileges to prevent misuse and ensure the security of network management operations.

- **Scalability and Performance:** 
  Consider the impact of node management functions on contract performance and gas costs, especially in large networks. Optimize state variable usage and function logic to maintain efficient contract operations.

- **Error Handling:** 
  Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected conditions. Ensure that operations fail gracefully and provide clear error messages to facilitate debugging and maintenance.
